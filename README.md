# K1 🏔
> Safer than K2

K1 is a fork of [Apple's _swift-crypto_](https://github.com/apple/swift-crypto), extending it with the [SECG](http://secg.org/) curve `secp256k1` using [Bitcoin core's C-library _secp256k1_](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) as underlying implementation, while preserving the entire structure Apple's framework [CryptoKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cryptokit).
